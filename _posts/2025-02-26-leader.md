# The art of not being the boss everyone quits

It's like that old saying: "A good leader inspires people to have confidence in the leader. A great leader inspires people to have confidence in themselves" — and a terrible leader inspires people to update their LinkedIn profile at 2 AM.

But how do you become the kind of manager people *don’t* run away from, like a new hire escaping a legacy codebase?  

## 1. Honesty: no smoke, no mirrors  
If your team hears about major changes before you tell them, you’ve got a problem.  

- Keep everyone informed about expectations, project status, and deadlines, **even when it’s bad news**.
- Foster a culture where people can speak up without fear—because if they’re only telling you what you want to hear, you’re flying blind.  
- Lead by doing, not by telling.
- No shady practices, no cutting corners. Ethical practices pay up for everyone in the long term.

## 2. Empathy: you're interacting with humans, not Jira tickets
A good leader isn’t just there for the sprint planning and approving days off. They’re also there when the sprint burns down in flames.  

- Actively listen—yes, actually **listen**, not just nod while thinking about your next meeting. Make your people feel like you actually see them as people, not as employees or (even worse) as EC2 instances.
- Celebrate wins publicly. Even small ones.
- If there is an issue, give feedback in private, and keep it constructive. Don't be the person who roasts people during meetings harder than a code review.  
- If your team is hesitating to DM you, you’re doing it wrong.

## 3. Empowerment: giving sudo access to potential  
You hired smart people. Now let them do their job.  

- Trust your team’s expertise. If you don’t, why did you hire them?  
- Provide opportunities for growth. No one wants to be stuck building file upload forms forever.  
- Don’t hoard all the fun tasks for yourself or your pals. Be the kind of leader who shares with everyone the cool projects, not just the tedious repetitive tasks.
- Don't punish mistakes. Blame (and fix) the process, not people. Turn that bug to a learning opportunity for everyone.
- Nurture a sharing environment of exploring raw, fragile ideas. How else will the team learn to cooperate and innovate?

## 4. Decision-Making: priorities change, adapt like a pro  
In software development, surprises aren’t if but when. Usually right before deployment.

- Stay calm when an urgent issue appears. Freaking out and pointing fingers doesn’t fix prod. If anything, it only makes people reluctant to get more work done.  
- Be transparent when priorities shift, nobody likes to throw a few weeks worth of work to the trash bin, but it's part of the job sometimes.
- Learn the fine art of saying "no" to noise. A distraction-free environment, is a getting-things-done environment.
- It isn't about having all the answers, but having a method that will help getting an informed decision.

## 5. Technical Competence: know your stack, mocking your skills doesn't work in prod
You don’t need to be the best coder on the team, but you do need to *understand* what’s going on.  

- Stay up to date with dev trends, but don’t chase every new frontend framework like a cat chasing a laser pointer.  
- Know enough to guide discussions and decisions without micromanaging.  
- Appreciate the challenge of maintaining software, because *code is like a tuna salad sandwich: it gets worse the longer it sits.*

At the end of the day, a great leader builds an environment where people feel **trusted, valued, and safe.**  

Because when a team isn’t busy navigating office politics, micromanagement, or unrealistic expectations…  
they can actually **focus on writing great software** and maybe even enjoy doing it.  

And isn’t that the dream?
