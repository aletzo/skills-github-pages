People don't leave their company. They leave their manager. 

But how can someone be a manager that people won't leave?

These are the top traits that a good leader should have:

###Honesty
Keep the team informed about changes, expectations, and project status.
Encourage open feedback and constructive discussions. The team members should not be afraid to be themselves or express their opinion.
Do the right thing.
Avoid at all costs unethical or illegal behaviors.
Lead by doing, not by telling.

###Empathy
Actively listen to team members. Understand their concerns and their perspective. Be in their shoes.
Provide emotional support during high-pressure situations.
Provide positive feedback publicly and celebrate wins, big or small.
Provide actionable, constructive feedback in private.
Never berate people or talk bad behind their backs.

###Empowerment
Trust the teamâ€™s expertise and avoid micromanaging.
Provide opportunities for growth and learning. Don't keep the most fun/challenging tasks for themselves.

###Decision making
Adjusting priorities. Unexpected "urgent" issues arise all of the time.

And since we are in the world of software development:

###Technical competence
Strong enough technical skills to understand the tech stack and the product vision.
Keep up to date with software development trends.
Understand the challenges of maintaining functional software.



A good leader can develop a positive environment where a trusting bond can grow between the team members. And when the team members are aligned and not worried, they can fully use their skills and competences in order to reach the goal.
